# A3--Software-Implementation

## Introduction
The Event Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline the management of events for The Best Events Company. The system allows the company to manage its employees, clients, suppliers, and events efficiently. It provides functionalities such as adding, deleting, modifying, and displaying details of employees, events, clients, guests, and suppliers. The system also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to perform these actions easily. Additionally, the system stores all details in binary files using the Pickle library in Python, ensuring data persistence and easy retrieval.
This project aims to enhance the operational efficiency of The Best Events Company by providing a centralized platform for managing all aspects of event planning and organization. By automating various processes and providing quick access to critical information, the system enables the company to deliver high-quality events while minimizing manual effort and errors. With its user-friendly interface and robust data management capabilities, the Event Management System serves as a valuable tool for enhancing productivity and customer satisfaction in the event management industry.

## Summary Learnings
In this project, I learned how to design and implement a software system for managing an event management company. I started by creating a UML class diagram to represent the concepts and relationships in the system, including employees, events, clients, guests, and suppliers. I used different types of association and inheritance relationships where necessary to model the relationships between these entities.

I then implemented the system using Python, using the Tkinter library to create a GUI. I added functionality to add, delete, modify, and display details of employees, events, clients, guests, and suppliers. I also implemented the ability to display all details of an employee, event, client, guest, or supplier given the ID number. Additionally, I used the Pickle library to store all details in binary files, ensuring that multiple binary files were used to store related information.

Overall, this project helped me improve my skills in software design, object-oriented programming, GUI development, and data storage. I learned how to create a functional and user-friendly system that can effectively manage the operations of an event management company.
